/**
 * outreach.js — bulk "send this message to N contacts" jobs.
 *
 * Why this isn't just a loop inside the route handler: sending to, say, 150
 * contacts with a human-like delay between each takes on the order of
 * 10-20 minutes. Doing that inside a single request/response cycle would
 * hold the connection open that whole time — the browser, any reverse
 * proxy in front of this (Caddy in production), and Render's own proxy in
 * the free-tier test earlier in this project would all time it out well
 * before it finished. So the route kicks the job off in the background and
 * returns immediately with a job id; the frontend polls for progress.
 *
 * The throttle and hard cap below aren't just politeness — WhatsApp's own
 * terms prohibit bulk/automated messaging, and their detection systems are
 * known to flag or ban numbers for sending many messages to many distinct
 * contacts in a short window, which is exactly the pattern an "outreach"
 * feature produces by definition. This can reduce how obviously
 * bot-shaped the traffic looks; it cannot make bulk outreach risk-free.
 * That risk is real and belongs in the product's UI, not just this
 * comment — see the warning copy wired up on the frontend.
 *
 * Job state is in memory and deliberately does not survive a restart. What
 * *does* survive is the message log: every successful send is recorded in
 * the database as it happens, so a job interrupted halfway leaves an
 * accurate record of what was actually sent rather than a job that looks
 * resumable and re-sends to people who already received it.
