/**
 * paths.js — single canonical source of truth for every persistence path.
 *
 * Why this module exists:
 *   Previously, `PERSIST_ROOT` was resolved independently in database.js,
 *   src/config/auth.js, and whatsapp-client.js, each with a slightly
 *   different fallback. A mismatch between where one module writes and where
 *   another reads is how sessions silently disappear after a restart, and the
 *   kind of bug that only surfaces in production under Docker or Render where
 *   the working directory differs from development.
 *
 *   Every stateful component now imports from here. There is exactly one
 *   place where PERSIST_ROOT is computed, so all paths are guaranteed to
 *   agree.
 *
 * PERSIST_ROOT resolution order:
 *   1. PERSIST_ROOT env var (explicit: Docker volume mount, Render disk, etc.)
 *   2. Two levels above this file (src/config/../../ = project root)
 *      Works for bare-Node development AND Docker where WORKDIR=/app.
 *
 * In Docker (WORKDIR /app, volumes mounted at /app/data, /app/.wwebjs_auth,
 * /app/.wwebjs_cache), this file resolves to /app — matching the Dockerfile's
 * VOLUME declarations exactly. No env var needed.
 *
 * On Render with a persistent disk at /app/persist, set:
 *   PERSIST_ROOT=/app/persist
 * and all paths land on the persistent disk.
