/**
 * launcher.js — Crash-proof wrapper for server.js with correct signal handling.
 *
 * Uses exponential back-off so a boot-loop doesn't hammer the system.
 *
 * Signal handling (critical for Docker / Render graceful shutdown):
 *
 *   SIGTERM/SIGINT are forwarded to the child server process.
 *   The launcher then waits for server.js to complete its own graceful
 *   shutdown (flush the database, close WhatsApp sessions, drain HTTP).
 *   If the server doesn't exit within the grace period, it is force-killed.
 *
 *   WITHOUT this forwarding, `docker stop` sends SIGTERM to PID 1 (the
 *   launcher). The old code called process.exit(0) immediately, which
 *   also killed the child — bypassing server.js's entire shutdown sequence.
 *   The database was never flushed and WhatsApp sessions were dropped abruptly.
 *
 * NOTE: In Docker, add `init: true` to the service (or use --init) so that
 * a proper init process (tini) handles PID 1 zombie reaping. The launcher
 * itself does not need to be PID 1 for signal forwarding to work, but tini
 * ensures orphaned Chromium child processes are reaped correctly.
