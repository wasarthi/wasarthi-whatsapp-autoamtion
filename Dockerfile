# --- WhatsApp Automation — production image ---------------------------------
# whatsapp-web.js drives a real headless Chromium per connected WhatsApp
# account, so this image needs the same system libraries a desktop Chrome
# install would need. This is the same package list already documented in
# README.md's "Requirements" section for a bare Linux server — a container
# needs it for the identical reason (it's still just Linux underneath).
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim

# `chromium` here (not just the shared libs a Chrome binary needs) is
# deliberate: package.json's puppeteer (a dependency of whatsapp-web.js) is
# on v24, and since puppeteer v20 its default `npm install` behavior is to
# download its own ~300MB "Chrome for Testing" build from Google's CDN
# during the postinstall step below. That download has no retry/resume, and
# on a build host with restricted or flaky egress to that CDN — some CI
# runners, some PaaS build sandboxes, some corporate/VPS networks — it just
# hangs or fails, which looks like "the deploy is broken" but is really "the
# build never finished." Installing a real Chromium from Debian's own apt
# mirror (already being hit for the libs below, so no new dependency on
# reachability) and pointing puppeteer at it with the two ENV lines further
# down skips that download entirely — smaller image, faster build, one less
# thing that can fail on a host you don't control the network policy of.
